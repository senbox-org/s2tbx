    <h3>Import SPOT DIMAP Products</h3>

    <p>This command allows to import the data of SPOT (1 to 5) products in DIMAP format.
        The products can be either compressed in a zip archive, or uncompressed in a specific folder structure.
    </p>

    <p>The DIMAP format is a public format for describing geographic data. Among its key features one can find:
        geocoded data sets, full raster layer description, any geographic area coverage, multiple data layers,
        super tiling (for very large datasets handling), and humanly readable metadata.<br/>
        For detailed information about this format, please have a look at the following documentation:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.spotimage.com/dimap/spec/documentation/refdoc.htm">DIMAP Reference Documentation</a></li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>A SPOT DIMAP product consists of two parts, one for the image - in GeoTIFF format - and the other for a description of the image - XML metadata.</p>
    <p>The general file structure of a SPOT DIMAP product is:
        <ul>
            <li>A volume metadata file, describing the contents of the folder structure</li>
            <li>One or more subfolders containing GeoTIFF images together with their associated DIMAP metadata</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>SPOT DIMAP products fall into one of the following two profiles:</p>

    <h4>SPOTScene</h4>

    <p>SPOTScene products are full satellite scenes preprocessed at levels 1A, 1B or 2A.</p>

    <h4>SPOT View</h4>

    <p>SPOTView products are full satellite scenes preprocessed at level 3.
        In the case of very large SPOTView products, they can contain more than one image. In this case, they are called "multi-volume" products.
        Each component image represents a tile of the overall scene.
        VISAT renders such products as a single-tiled product on the fly.
