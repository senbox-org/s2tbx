<h3>Export JP2 Product</h3>

<p>This command allows to export the data of the current product to JP2 file.</p>

<p>JPEG 2000 (JP2) is an image compression standard and coding system. Although the JPEG 2000 standard format does not include geocoding,
    it does allow for extra information to be inserted within the file. The goecoding is encripted using  Geography Markup Language (GML). The primary
    role of GMLJP2 is to provide an XML encoding of the metadata necessary to make the JPEG document a georeferenced or geographic image
    This is accomplished by providing, in GML, the description of the image geometry. JPEG 2000 files
    containing GMLJP2 markup can be located and displayed in the correct position on the earth's surface by a Geographic Information System (GIS)
    that supports the format. Generally,  GML data can be used to encode coverage metadata, geographic features, annotations, and supporting components
    for coordinate reference systems and unit of measure definitions.
    The JP2 encoding is done using the openjpeg library which is an open-source JPEG-2000 codec written in C language.<br/>
    For further information have a look at the following documentations:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://jpeg.org/jpeg2000/">JPEG2000 Homepage</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.openjpeg.org/">OpenJPEG Homepage</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/gml">GML Homepage</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Constraints of written JP2 product files</h3>

<p>The exported JP2 files written by the OpenJpeg library contain all the JP2 file format headers except for the XML header box that is added manually.
    This XML header box is used for additional information like geoCoding with Geography Markup Language provided as XML encoding thus allowing a
    better support of several Snap Toolbox features.<br/>
</p>

<p>
    For features and limitations of the JP2 export and constraints of interaction with other GIS tools, please see
    the following list:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>All bands of a JP2 file must have at most 16 bit-depth; so products with bands that have bit-depth greater than 16 will not be encoded, 
        due to Openjpeg library limitations.</li>
    <li>The data of a band is always written raw and unscaled.</li>
    <li>The JP2 does not contain Vector data.</li>
    <li>The additional information in the JP2 file consists only of geoCoding, no other metadata information is available.</li>
    <li>JP2 supports all projections available in the SNAP application, although exports projections only in tie-point grid format.<br/></li>
    <li>The masks of the exported product can not be saved in the JP2 format.</li>

</ul>
