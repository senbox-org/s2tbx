<h3>User Interface</h3>

<p>
    The S2 MCI processor can be invoked in the Sentinel Toolbox from tool menu by selecting
    <b>Processing->Thematic Water Processing->S2 MCI Processor...</b>.
    On the command line the MCI processor is available by means of the Graph Processing Tool <code>gpt</code>
    which is located in the Sentinel Toolbox <code>bin</code> directory.
    Typing <code>gpt Mci.s2 -h</code> displays further information.
</p>

<p>
    Selecting the <b>S2 MCI Processor</b> command from the Sentinel Toolbox tool menu pops up the following dialog:
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../images/IOParameters.png"></p>

<h5>Source Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Source product:</b>
    Here the user specifies the source product.
    The combo box presents a list of all products opened in the Sentinel Toolbox.
    The user may select one of these or, by clicking on the button next to the combo box, choose a product
    from the file system.
</p>

<h5>Target Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name:</b>
    Used to specify the name of the target product.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Save as:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be saved to the file system. The
    combo box presents a list of available file formats.
    The text field or the button next to it allow to specify a target directory.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Open in SNAP:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be opened in the Sentinel Toolbox.
    When the target product is not saved, it is opened in the Sentinel Toolbox automatically.
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../images/ProcessingParameters.png"></p>

<h5>Processing Parameters Panel</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Preset:</b> Select one of the available presets from the predefined list.
    Available presets are:
</p>
<dl class="i1">
    <dt><b>S2MSI L1C MCI</b></dt>
    <dd>S2 MSI maximum chlorophyll index (lower=B4, upper=B6, signla=B5)</dd>
    <dt><b>S2MSI L2 MCI</b></dt>
    <dd>S2 MSI L2 (sen2cor) maximum chlorophyll index (lower=B4, upper=B6, signla=B5)</dd>
</dl>
<p class="i1">
    A preset selects the bands used to calculate the baseline, the signal band,
    the line height band and the slope band.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Lower baseline band name:</b> The name for the lower wavelength band defining
    the baseline. Enter a band name or select one of the list of available bands
    (only available when an input product is already selected).
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Upper baseline band name:</b>
    The name of the upper wavelength band defining
    the baseline. Enter a band name or select one of the list of available bands
    (only available when an input product is already selected).
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Signal band name:</b> The name of the signal band, i.e. the band for
    which the baseline height is calculated. Enter a band name or select one of
    the list of available bands (only available when an input product is already
    selected).
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Line height band name:</b> The name of the line height band in the
    target product.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Generate slope parameter:</b>
    Activates or deactivates calculating the slope parameter.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Slope band name:</b> The name of the slope band in the target product
    (disabled when calculating the slope is deactivated)
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Mask expression:</b>
    A ROI-mask expression to be evaluated during processing. Used to define pixels of interest.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Cloud correction factor:</b>
    The cloud correction factor used during calculation. See <a href="MciAlgorithmSpecification.html">algorithm
    documentation</a> for details.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Invalid MCI value:</b>
    The value written to a target pixel when it is excluded from the ROI or the MCI calculation yields an invalid
    result.
</p>

<h5>Button Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Run</b>
    Creates the target product. The MCI processing is actually deferred until its band data are accessed, either by
    writing the product to a file or by viewing its band data. When the <b>Save as</b> option is checked, the MCI
    processing is triggered automatically.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Close</b>
    Closes the dialog.
</p>

<h5>Menu Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>File</b>
    The entries found in this menu allow to save the current processing parameters to disk and to open a saved parameter
    set from disk.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Help</b>
    Contains entries for accessing the help pages and information about this processor.
