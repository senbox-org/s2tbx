<h3>NDPI</h3>

<p>
    The <u><b>N</b></u>ormalized <u><b>D</b></u>ifference <u><b>P</b></u>ond <u><b>I</b></u>ndex
    algorithm was developed by J.P Lacaux & al., (2006). <br><br>


    The NDPI makes it possible not only to distinguish small ponds and water bodies (down to 0.01 ha), but also to differentiate vegetation inside ponds from that in their surroundings <br><br>
</p>



<p>
    The NDPI results from the following equation:
</p>

<p>
    <b>NDPI = (mir_factor * middle_IR - green_factor * green) / (mir_factor * middle_IR + green_factor * green)</b> <br><br>

</p>


<h3>NDPI-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'ndpi_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for NDPI is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for NDPI is less than -1 (minus one)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for NDPI is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>
</table>
