<h3>RI</h3>

<p>
    The <u><b>R</b></u>edness <u><b>I</b></u>ndex algorithm was developed to identify soil colour variations - Pouget et al.(1990) <br><br>

</p>


<p>
    The RI results from the following equation: <br>
</p>

<p>
    <b>RI = (red_factor * red * red_factor * red) / (green_factor * green * green_factor * green * green_factor * green)</b><br><br>
</p>


<h3>RI-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'ri_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for RI is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for RI is less than -1 (minus one)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for RI is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>
</table>
