<h3>Spectral Angle Mapper</h3>
Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) is a physically-based spectral classification that uses an n-D angle to match pixels to reference spectra.
The algorithm determines the spectral similarity between two spectra by calculating the angle between the spectra and treating them as
vectors in a space with dimensionality equal to the number of bands. This technique, when used on calibrated reflectance data, is relatively
insensitive to illumination and albedo effects. Endmember spectra used by SAM can come from CSV files or you can extract
them directly from an image (as ROI average spectra). SAM compares the angle between the endmember spectrum vector and each pixel vector in n-D space.
Smaller angles represent closer matches to the reference spectrum. Pixels further away than the specified maximum angle threshold in radians are not classified.

<br><br>SAM classification assumes reflectance data. However, if you use radiance data, the error is generally not significant because the origin is still near zero.
<br><br> The spectral angle <b><i>&#952;</i></b> is defined as (Kruse et al., 1993):<br>
<center><img src="../images/SamFormula.png"></center> <br>
Where:
<p class="i1">
    <i><b>x</b></i>= spectral signature vector of an image pixel;<br>
    <i><b>y</b></i> = spectral signature vector of a training area;<br>
    <i><b>n</b></i> = number of image bands.
</p>
Therefore a pixel belongs to the class having the lowest angle, that is:
<center><img src="../images/capture.png"></center> <br>
where:
<p class="i1">
    <i><b>C<sub>k</sub></b></i> = land cover class k;<br>
    <i><b>y<sub>k</sub></b></i> = spectral signature of class k;<br>
    <i><b>y<sub>j</sub></b></i> = spectral signature of class j.
</p>
<br>

In order to exclude pixels below this value from the classification it is possible to define a threshold <i><b>T<sub>i</sub></b></i>:

                In case the bands involved in the calculus are not of the same resolution,

                band as reference, or the highest resolution one.<br><br>

                If the resampling will be done for the highest resolution band,
                this is the method used for upsampling lower resolution bands.
                Can be one of: <strong>Nearest neighbour, Bilinear, Bicubic</strong>.<br><br>
                <strong>Downsampling Method</strong><br>

<h4>Spectral Classes CSV Format</h4>
<p class="i1">
    The CSV format used to import and export spectrum classes is a plain text format.
    It comprises a header line defining the spectrum classes. The second line defines if the respective input is user defined or is one used from
    the shapes drawn using the <strong>rectangle drawing tool, polygon drawing tool</strong> or the <strong> ellipse drawing tool</strong>. <br><br>
    The values represent pixel position for each spectrum input class. First line is the X coordinate and the next one is the Y coordinate of a pixel and so on. The
    number of inputs must be even. If two inputs are introduced it means that the spectral angle will define a class and use as reference a single pixel. If
    4 values are introduced it means that the spectral angle will define a class and use as reference a mean value of the 2 pixels locations introduced. If 6 or
    more values are introduced those will represent the corners of a polygon shape and the spectral angle will define a class and use as reference
    a mean value of the pixels that are situated within the polygon shape defined by the input location pixels introduced.  <br><br>
    It should be taken into consideration that the pixels locations must be within the image size. When working with multi-size products the pixel values introduced
    by the user must be defined in the range of the size the target product will have meaning that if the user wants the target product to be resampled to the smallest
    size, the pixel values must be taken from the band that has the smallest size and vice versa. In case of shapes drawn there is no problem as the algorithm automatically
    transpose the shape accordingly with the target product size.<br><br>
    The <strong>,</strong> character is used to separate header and record fields. Given here is an example of the contents of a CSV spectrum class input file:
